# Bassive

## Sound without Sound

Boost is a mobile app with the purpose of aiding stroke patients in their recovery after they get discharged from the hospital.

When in the hospital, the patients constantly work on their recovery with the help of nurses and physical therapists throughout the day, but from the moment they get discharged they usually only do one hour of physical therapy per day.

With the usage of screen interaction, the microphone and the phone’s accelerometer, Boost mimics the type of exercises these patients would normally do in the hospital, like moving a ball from point A to point B, moving their arm up and down for a certain amount of reps to work on their mobility and even speech and cognitive exercises to work on diction and memory.

By keeping track of their progress and giving them the possibility to earn progress awards, Boost keeps its users motivated and active on a daily basis. The app also tracks the patients’ steps and other daily statistics to remind the users that they must reach their daily goals in order to recover as fast as possible.
