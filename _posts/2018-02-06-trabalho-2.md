# Bassive

## Sound without Sound

Bassive is an app that allows the deaf and hard of hearing to appreciate a complete music experience in an easy and accessible way. For people with full hearing capabilities, music is something really present in their day to day, but our target has to use really specific strategies to be able to appreciate it. This app reunites in itself a complete sensorial experience by using vision, touch and the cognitive side of music in order to provide our users with the best possible musical experience.
