# Neon Rose

## Free Speech Movement, Magazine

"NEON ROSE" is a periodic multimedia publication about student protests. Inspired by the 
Free Speech Movement, in 1964, it proposes a reflection on how these protests of the sixties 
counterculture affect today's youth and the way we choose to protest and express our issues, 
such as the enormous rise of student tuition. 

It includes: two booklets (one serves as context, taking the reader through the Free Speech Movement and what it was all about; the other is used to showcase the protests of today's youth and to show that we can still stand up for ourselves and speak up about societies issues); a DVD with interviews with students that take part in 
today's protests and like to have their opinion heard; and a poster with a diagram that shows 
the evolution of student protests.
