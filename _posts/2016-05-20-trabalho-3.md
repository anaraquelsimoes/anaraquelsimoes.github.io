# Amazon

## Desktop + Mobile Redesign

Redesign of the Amazon website (amazon.com). It was the final project of the main subject of the Posgraduate Course in Digital Experience Design (first semester). The main goals of the project were (among others) to improve the usability and navigability of the website, make the user experience more personalized and improve the readability and orientation on product pages. It was a rather complex challenge and it helped me to consolidate my knowledge in the UX and UI subjects.
