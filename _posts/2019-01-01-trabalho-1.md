# BOOST

## Stroke Recovery App

Boost is a mobile app with the purpose of aiding stroke patients in their recovery after they get discharged from the hospital.

With the usage of screen interaction, the microphone and the phone’s accelerometer, Boost mimics the type of exercises these patients would normally do in the hospital, like moving a ball from point A to point B, moving their arm up and down for a certain amount of reps to work on their mobility and even speech and cognitive exercises to work on diction and memory.

By keeping track of their progress and giving them the possibility to earn progress awards, Boost keeps its users motivated and active on a daily basis. The app also tracks the patients’ steps and other daily statistics to remind the users that they must reach their daily goals in order to recover as fast as possible.

# The Process

I started by drawing out a sitemap and the main user flow to get an idea of how this would be structured and what were the focal points of the app. Given that a lot of the users would be elders, I tried to keep the structure really simple and intuitive so that anyone could use it with ease.
