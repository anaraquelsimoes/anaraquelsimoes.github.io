# In the Mood for Love?

## Love, Sex & Generation

In The Mood For Love? intends to create a reflection around the connection between love and sexuality. Is the distinction between the two far too thin nowadays? Does our youth still need to feel love in order to get involved sexually? Virtual is the new Real and, with that, a like on instagram is the new wink across the club. 

The project In the Mood for Love? brings this strange new reality to light and stirs up a conversation about the way young people today perceive and act on their amorous relationships.
