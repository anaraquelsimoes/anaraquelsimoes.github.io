# NBD

## No Big Deal, The Webapp

NBD is a Web App that has the sole purpose of connecting people who’s needs complement one another. More specifically, needs related to daily tasks like walking your dog, fixing your garden, cleaning your house, cooking and baking, OR services that you are not skilled to do, like wedding photography, carpentry, plumbing, make-up, etc.

With NBD you can hire someone to do these things for you or be hired by someone else to do something you’re skilled at. It’s a service from people to people and it’s main goal is to help make your life easier.
